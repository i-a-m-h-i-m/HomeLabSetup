# HomeLabSetup
Setting up homelab
This is where I will document the REFRESHED setup for my homelab. Most of my boxes are running on decommissioned software and I need to catch up with the times. I will also use this area as a playground to setup new technologies (k8s, webapps, dbs, etc, juniper swithces, FW). I will use this area to test new technologies/pipelines to see what I like most.
